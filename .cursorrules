# PolicyReady Project Rules

## Project Overview
Healthcare compliance audit tool that ingests PDFs, indexes them with keyword-based search, and uses GPT-4 to evaluate audit questions with structured evidence output.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
- Frontend: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
- Search: Inverted keyword index (JSON)
- LLM: OpenAI GPT-4 with structured outputs

## Code Style

### Python (Backend)
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Keep services in separate modules under `app/services/`
- No unnecessary abstractions - keep it simple

### TypeScript (Frontend)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Keep API calls in `lib/api.ts`
- Use Tailwind for styling - no CSS modules

## Architecture Principles
- Fail-closed: If no explicit evidence exists, mark as NOT_MET
- Evidence-first: LLM must provide verbatim quotes
- Simple MVP: Only implement what's strictly necessary
- Clear separation: Services handle business logic, routes handle HTTP

## File Organization
- Backend: `backend/app/` with `services/`, `models.py`
- Frontend: `frontend/src/app/` for pages, `components/` for reusable UI

## Comments
- No emojis in comments
- Comment only when logic is non-obvious
- Prefer self-documenting code
